            How about the above drawing?<br>
            This is a picture which is from a movie called <strong>Good Will Hunting</strong> .<br>
            When I saw this drawing, a novel unlosed upwell in my mind – <strong><em>the old man and the sea</em></strong> .<br>
            When I was young, I read this novel and I couldn’ t understand the old man at that time --Why a man does something useless?<br>
            Now ,I am not a boy but a man ,I admire the old man now.<br>
            During my growing time, there is always somebody around me who was saying “You are doing something useless”
            when I do something different with another. Honestly, these words let me upset. But a faith around my heart tells me
            that I just do what I consider right.<br>
            For me, the sea is code and the old man is me, although nobody agree with me, I am still on my way. Maybe I will bring back the fish bone, I become
            what I wanna be.</p>
