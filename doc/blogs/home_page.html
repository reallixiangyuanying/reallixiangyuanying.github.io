            How about the above drawing?<br>
            This is a picture which from a movie called <strong>Good Will Hunting</strong> .<br>
            When I saw this drawing, a novel unlosed upwell in my mind – <strong><em>the old man and the sea</em></strong> .<br>
            When I was young, I read this novel and I can’t understood the old man atthat time --Why a man do something useless?<br>
            Now ,I am not a boy but a man ,I admire the old man now.<br>
            In my growth time, always somebody around me who said “You do some useless thing” when I do something different with another. Honestly, this word let me upset. But a faith around my heart that I just do what I consider right.<br>
            For me, the sea is code and the old man is me, although nobody identity with me, I also on my way. Maybe I will lead back a fish bone, I become what I wanna become – a man insist his point.</p>
