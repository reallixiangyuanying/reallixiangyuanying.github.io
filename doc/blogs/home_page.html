    How about the drawing above?<br>
    This is a picture from a movie called <strong>Good Will Hunting</strong> .<br>
    When I saw this drawing, a novel unlosed unfold in my mind – <strong><em>the old man and the sea</em></strong> .<br>
    When I was a boy, I read this novel and I couldn’ t understand the old man at that time --Why a man does something
    meaningless?<br>
    Now ,I am not a boy but a man ,I admire the old man.<br>
    During my growing time, there is always somebody around me who was saying “You are doing something meaningless”
    when I do something different from others. Honestly, these words upset me. But the faith in my heart tells me to do
    what I consider as right thing.<br>
    For me, the code is the sea which is vast and endless and I am the old man who is persistent and stubborn, Maybe
    nobody agree with me, but I am still on my way. The day I bring back the giant fishbone will be the day I become the
    hero to myself.
