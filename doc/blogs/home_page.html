    <p>This blog is for talk about programming. Personally, it 's special for <strong>javascript</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>
        and <strong>CSS</strong> as also as <strong>clojure</strong>. Now this blog is deplog in github page, but
        finally, I will let it become a really personal blog (with database and back-end) with
        <strong>clojure</strong>, some code you cound find in github <a href="https://github.com/JciGi/JciBl"><em>“JciBl”</em></a>.<be/>
        If you interested in <strong>front-end</strong> develpment, there are some blog (<em>“Jci’s Blog”</em>)[<a
                href="http://google.com">google.com</a>] about it.<br/>
