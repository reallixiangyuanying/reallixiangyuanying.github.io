<h3>why as a web developer you should use linux rather than windows?</h3>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Because many guide for programmig tool is write for linux.</li>
<li>Because in windows, build development enviroment is too headache.For example, in ubuntu(linux a kind of), you just type two command line <code>curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash -</code> and <code>sudo apt-get install -y nodejs</code>, but in windows, you should download something.exe, and install it, always, some error will occur(because many programmig tool is run in linux in production,so the author will not spent too many to let his program run finely in windows,like <strong>ruby on rails</strong>).</li>
<li>Because linux suppose command line better, command line is not for ‘looks cool’, but for increase productivity <a href="%22https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-using-CLI-rather-than-GUI%22">answer in quora</a>.</li>
<li>Because linux let you more understand how computer works but not "I am your Dad, your computer should restart for update,  don’t close it! ".</li>
