When I saw this drawing, a novel unlosed upwell in my mind -- ***the old man and the sea*** .
> When I was young, I read this novel and I can't understood the old man atthat time --Why a man do something useless?
> Now ,I am not a boy but a man ,I admire the old man now.
> In my growth time, always somebody around me who said "You do some useless thing" when I do something different with another. Honestly, this word let me upset. But a faith around my heart that I just do what I consider right.
> For me, the sea is code and the old man is me, although nobody identity with me, I also on my way. Maybe I will lead back a fish bone, I become what I wanna become -- a man insist his point.
